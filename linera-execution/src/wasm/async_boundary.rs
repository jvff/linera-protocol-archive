//! Helper types to handle async code between the host WebAssembly runtime and guest WebAssembly
//! modules.

use tokio::sync::Mutex;

/// A type to keep track of a [`std::task::Context`] so that it can be forwarded to any async code
/// called from the guest WASM module.
///
/// When a [`Future`] is polled, a [`Context`] is used so that the task can be scheduled to be
/// woken up and polled again if it's still awaiting something. The context has a lifetime, and can
/// only be used during the call to the future's poll method.
///
/// The problem is that calling a WASM module from an async task can lead to that guest code
/// calling back some host async code. The task context must then be forwarded from the host code
/// that called the guest code to the host code that was called from the guest code.
///
/// Because the context has a lifetime and that forwarding lifetimes through the runtime calls is
/// not possible, this type erases the lifetime of the context and stores it in an `Arc<Mutex<_>>`
/// so that the context can be obtained again later. To ensure that this is safe, an
/// [`ActiveContextGuard`] instance is used to remove the context from memory before the lifetime
/// ends.
