//! Joining of flat layouts of different variants of a `variant` type.
//!
//! When flattening `variant` types, a single flat layout must be obtained for the type by joining
//! the flat layout of each variant. This means finding a flat type for each layout element to
//! represent the flat type of any of the variants. See [`crate::primitive_types::JoinFlatTypes`]
//! for more information on how flat types are joined.
